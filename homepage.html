							<h3>PURPOSE OF REPORT</h3>
							<p>
								The Sacramento City Unified School Board asked us to investigate whether transforming HPHS into a grades 7-12 integrated middle
		school-high school – creating a “community learning center” K-12 pathway on one block, from a K-6 Leataata Floyd Elementary to a grades
		7-12 Health Professions Middle/High School - would benefit Sacramento students and families, especially those in the Upper Land Park
		neighborhood around those schools.

								The grade 7-12 middle-high school model at Health Professions High is intriguing possible “two birds with one stone” solution – one that could provide
		an alternative, better “community learning center” pathway to graduation for Leataata Floyd Elementary’s students while also consistently supporting
		enrollment at Arthur A. Benjamin Health Professions High School. A community learning center on the same block as a K-12 pathway could centralize
		community services and support programs for students in one location.
		<br><br>We studied this idea for six months to weigh the benefits and risks of adding grades 7 and 8 to Health Professions High School, and make a
		recommendation to the Sacramento City Unified School Board about what to do.
