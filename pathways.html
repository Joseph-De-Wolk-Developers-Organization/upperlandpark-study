                        and 6th grade (2012-13) within the Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD). </p>

                    <p> Note: 7th grade is not displayed because most students went to the same school for 7th and 8th grade.
                        For some of the 28 students at HPHS, no school data was provided for 6th and/or 8th grades.
                        These students are placed in the 'Out of District' categories as they must have entered from a school outside of SCUSD. </p>
