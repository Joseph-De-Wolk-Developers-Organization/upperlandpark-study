<h1> Appendix C: Health Professions High School Cohort Pathways Through Sacramento City District </h1>

<p> This diagram displays where the 9th grade students at Arthur A. Benjamin Health Professions High (HPHS) in school years 2014-15 and 2015-16 went to 8th grade (2013-14 and 2014-15)
 and 6th grade (2011-12 and 2012-13) within the Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD). The diagram shows the pathways of 67 total students, 
52 students in the HPHS 2014-15 9th grade class and 28 students in the HPHS 2015-16 9th grade class. </p>

<p> Move your cursor over the diagram to view the number of students in each pathway.</p>

<p> To note:
<ul>
  <li> The diagram below may not represent all students at HPHS in years specified. 
It was created with data supplied by the SCUSD, with clarification that dataset may be incomplete.</li>
  <li> Before 2012-13, Leataata Floyd elementary school was named Jedediah Smith. This diagram characterizes both schools as 'Leataata Floyd*'.</li>
  <li> 7th grade is not displayed because most students went to the same school for 7th and 8th grade.  </li>
  <li> For some of the students from Leataata Floyd, no school data was provided for 8th and/or 9th grades.
These students are placed in the 'Out of District/Drop Out' category for specified grade as they either moved to a school out of the SCUSD jurisdiction or dropped out of school.</li>
  <li> Dataset included some abbreviated school names; abbreviations remain in diagram and in lists below of schools not shown in diagram. </li>
